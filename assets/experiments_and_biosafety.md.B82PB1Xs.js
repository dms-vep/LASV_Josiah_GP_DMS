Pseudotyping is a <a href="https://blog.addgene.org/viral-vectors-101-pseudotyping" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">widely used and safe method</a> to study viral entry proteins, since the pseudoviruses can only undergo a single cycle of infection and therefore pose no risk of transmission or replication in humans or any other animals. For this reason, they provide a safe way to study mutations to proteins from even biosafety level 4 viruses (e.g., Lassa virus GPC) at biosafety level 2.</p><p>See the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.05.579020v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">preprint</a> describing this study for more details.</p>',4),n=[i];function o(d,l,p,_,c,f){return a(),t("div",null,n)}const y=e(r,[["render",o]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
