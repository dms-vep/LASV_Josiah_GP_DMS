Positive cell entry values indicate better entry than the parental GPC while negative values indicate impaired entry. Positive escape values indicate reduced neutralization by an antibody while negative values indicate more neutralization.</p><p>Here is an explanation of the key plot elements:</p><ul><li>The zoom bar at the top of the plot shows different regions of GPC, and can be used to zoom in on specific sites.</li><li>The line plots summarize the average escape from neutralization by all six monoclonal antibodies, and then below that in gray the escape for each individual antibody. The height of each line summarizes the total escape caused by mutations at each site using the <em>site escape statistic</em> specified by the interactive options at the bottom of the plot.</li><li>The heatmaps show how each individual mutation affects each phenotype. The <code>x</code>&#39;s indicate the amino-acid identity in the parental GPC strain, light gray indicates mutations that were not measured, and dark gray indicates mutations that are filtered out by one of the interactive sliders at the bottom of the plot (eg, they have a very negative effect on cell entry). You can mouse over any of the points for details.</li><li>The options at the bottom of the plot allow you to interactively adjust what is displayed. For instance, the <em>minimum mutation entry in 293T cells</em> only shows mutations with at least some minimal cell entry function (and grays out mutations that are more deleterious). You can also select to floor the escape at zero to show / not show &quot;negative&quot; escape values.</li></ul><p>Click on the expansion box in the upper right of the plot to enlarge it for easier viewing, or <a href="/LASV_Josiah_GP_DMS/htmls/phenotypes_faceted.html" target="_self">click here</a> to open the plot in a stand-alone window.</p>',6);function d(m,p,u,f,y,b){const a=e("Altair"),o=e("Figure");return r(),i("div",null,[h,t(o,{caption:"Interactive plot showing effects of mutations on all phenotypes"},{default:s(()=>[t(a,{showShadow:!0,"spec-url":"htmls/phenotypes_faceted.html"})]),_:1})])}const w=n(c,[["render",d]]);export{v as __pageData,w as default};
