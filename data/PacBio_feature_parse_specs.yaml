# Description:
# YAML file that specifies how .parse_alignment method parses the alignments
# for each feature of the amplicon. Filters will be applied in the order the 
# features appear in the feature_parse_specs.

# Name of amplicon

  # keys ‘query_clip5’ and ‘query_clip3’ give the max amount that 
  # can be clipped from each end of the query prior to the alignment

  query_clip3: 12
  # Feature of amplicon

    # filter: dict keyed by ‘clip5’, ‘clip3’, ‘mutation_nt_count’, and ‘mutation_op_count’
