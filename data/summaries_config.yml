# Configuration for creating summary plots across assays.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define how to create an integrated set of line plots and heat maps that summarizes
# antibody escape alongside other assays (eg, functional effects of mutations).

  legend: |
    This is is an interactive chart. Mouseover points for details and measurements, and
    use the top zoom bar to zoom in on specific sites. The options at the bottom let you
    only show escape for sites with some minimal functional effect, choose the site
    summary metric, or floor the escape at zero.

    The line plots at top show the escape at each site across all sera and for individual
    sera, and the heatmaps show the effects of individual mutations on sera escape or
    functions of the protein.
