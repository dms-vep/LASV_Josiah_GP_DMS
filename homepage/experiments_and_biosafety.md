# Experiments and biosafety

The paper describing this study is [Carr, Crawford, et al (2024)](https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(24)00319-4). The measurements are all made using a pseudovirus-based deep mutational scanning system that was originally described in [Dadonaite et al (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.02.001).

A key aspect of this system is that it utilizes pseudotyped lentiviral virions that encode no viral genes other than the viral entry protein (in this case GPC).
Pseudotyping is a [widely used and safe method](https://blog.addgene.org/viral-vectors-101-pseudotyping) to study viral entry proteins, since the pseudoviruses can only undergo a single cycle of infection and therefore pose no risk of transmission or replication in humans or any other animals.
For this reason, they provide a safe way to study mutations to proteins from even biosafety level 4 viruses (e.g., Lassa virus GPC) at biosafety level 2.
