# Library construction

This directory contains sub-directories for the steps of making the LASV GP
pseudotyped lentivirus DMS library.

## Directories:

### `design`:
    
    Contains:
    1. Notebooks, alignments, and trees for initial analysis of Arenavirus GP diversity used to determine what regions of LASV GP to mutate.
    Decided to not exclude any parts of GP.

    2. Directory containing the script, sequence, and primers for the final library design.

### `sanger_analysis`:
    Contains:
    1. Lists of mutations for each round of mutagenesis as well as the script and resulting analyses of the results of Sanger sequencing >8 clones per library.
        Kate's local version contains the `.ab1` trace files, but these are not tracked by GitHub.

### `titers`:
    Contains:
    1. `csv` files of titers from transfection and recovery for making the LASV GP libraries. 
    2. Jupyter notebooks and output figures for plotting those titers.
