# Non-pipeline analyses
The code and data used for library construction, phylogeny analysis, virus titers, and virus neutralization assays are included in the following subdirectories.

## Repo organization
 
* `library_construction` directory contains directories for library design and initial PCR mutagenesis QC (using Sanger sequencing).
* `titers_and_neuts` directory contains scripts and data for testing virus titers and monoclonal antibody neutralization. The data includes a combination of flow-based and luciferase-based results.
