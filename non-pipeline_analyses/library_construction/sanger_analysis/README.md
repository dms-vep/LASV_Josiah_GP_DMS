# Sanger sequencing to choose plasmid library

This repo contains the input and output files for running Jesse's original
mutation analysis script for analyzing expected mutation rates, etc. 
from DMS plasmid libraries. 

The analyses in this repo were used to select the Rnd1-10 library for the
LASV GP libraries.
